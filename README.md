## Summary
Ashiria, Emily, Sani 
The game we developed is called "Beaver Jump", a feature-enhanced variation of Doodle Jump with a beaver as the main character. The objective is to jump as high as possible without falling or getting hit by enemy projectiles. As the beaver ascends, it accumulates points and power-ups, adding layers of excitement and challenge to the gameplay.

## Gameplay
Inspired by Doodle Jump, "Beaver Jump" is a dynamic vertical platformer where the player controls a beaver, continuously jumping on tiles to ascend higher on the screen. As the beaver progresses, the background shifts upward, creating a seamless, animated scrolling effect. Points accumulate as the player advances, and the challenge intensifies with the introduction of an airborne enemy. This enemy moves horizontally across the top of the screen, launching projectiles from random locations. While it never directly interacts with the beaver, the player must avoid being hit by its bullets. The game ends if the beaver falls off the tiles or is struck by a projectile. Although there is no definitive winning condition, players aim to achieve the highest possible score by surviving and progressing upward.

Player movement is controlled using the keyboard, allowing the beaver to navigate side to side while jumping between tiles. The game features a physics engine that simulates realistic collisions, gravity, and spring mechanics, enhancing the overall gameplay experience. Tiles and bullets are represented by polygons, while sprites are used for the beaver and the enemy invader, creating a visually engaging environment.
